## 👽 About Me

I'm a Software Engineer and Fractional CTO with a passion for turning ideas into real, working products. Over the past decade, I’ve worked across Native Mobile Development, Web Development, and even AR/VR projects. I’ve had the privilege of founding a few startups and leading some amazing engineering teams along the way. I like to keep things simple but effective. I’m a big believer in adapting agile methodologies to fit what actually works for the project. I focus on building scalable, quality software that people love using. Whether it's fine-tuning or organizing code for a clean scale, I’m always striving to improve the process. I'm constantly learning, iterating, and staying driven, which is probably why I enjoy what I do so much. Feel free to dive into my projects, and if something sparks your interest, reach out I'm always up for a chat.
